      Coffee and Parkinson’s disease Various studies have suggested that
      caffeine, which is present in coffee and many other beverages, may help
      protect against Parkinson’s disease. One team concluded that men who drink
      over four cups of coffee per day might have a fivefold lower risk of
      Parkinson’s disease than those who do not. The findings of the 2017
      meta-analysisTrusted Source suggested a link between coffee consumption
      and a lower risk of Parkinson’s disease, even among people who smoke. This
      team also found that people who drink coffee may be less likely to
      experience depression and cognitive conditions such as Alzheimer’s
      disease.
